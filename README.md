# Next-Frame-Prediction
This repositior contains the notebook which implemts the model which can predict the future frame given the  past sereis of frames.

## 1) Next Frame Predictions using Tensorflow

The model is built using Convolutional LSTM layers, and it was tested on Moving MNIST Dataset.
Link to the dataset can be found [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nitish/unsupervised_video/)
